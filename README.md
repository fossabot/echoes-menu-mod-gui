This is a GUI front end for patching Metroid Prime 2: Echoes game ISOs with the
[Menu Mod](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhqqafaxfo3l4vn/Echoes%20Menu.7z) practice tool made

Menu Mod is a game modification that allows you to warp to any room in the game, modify your equipment and change
room state. For more details, see the
